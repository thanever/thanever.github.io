<p>
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the Univeristy of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/dhill/" target="_blank">Prof. David J. Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/~yhhou/index.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Yunhe Hou</a>. I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree both in Power System and its Automation, in 2015 and 2018 respectively, from North China Elecric Power University. My research lies in analysis, optimization and control of power systems. And I mainly focus on structure-oriented methonds for power system analysis, optimization and control during my PhD period.
