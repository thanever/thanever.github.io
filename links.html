         <p>The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and experimenting with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other general-purpose single and multi-objective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, ε-MOEA, GDE3, PAES, PESA2, SPEA2, IBEA, SMS-EMOA, SMPSO, OMOPSO, CMA-ES, and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization algorithms.  MOEA Framework also provides APIs for some common programming languages, such as C and Python.</p>
