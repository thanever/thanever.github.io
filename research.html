  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>
    My research lies in analysis, optimization and control of power systems. And I currently focus on structure-oriented methonds for power system analysis, optimization and control. This page describes my current main directions, past research and some side projects.

      <p>Power systems are intrinsically important to a functioning society. However, there is still a crucial question having not been
      fully and theoretically understood — how does the power network structure influence its stability? A series of studies is
      proposed to systematically understand this topological influence and utilize it:
      <ul>
        <li>Establish structure-oriented analysis methods that explicitly capture the network structure for different aspects of stability.</li>
        <li>Interpret The influence of network structure on stability theoretically and improve the analysis methods by capturing the crucial structure information.</li>
        <li>And propose new methods for optimizing and controlling the power system topologically, by applying the established structure-oriented analysis methods and the discover impact of the underlying topological structure on power system stability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This project aims at a deep investigation for the false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against practical power systems. From a nonlinear time-varying perspective and considering actual situation of power systems, I am studying the potential forms and corresponding probability of FDIAs. Combining the detection-based and protection-based countermeasures, a novel conjoint countermeasure is expected in our work to overcome the omission and costliness of these two separate countermeasures respectively.</br>
      Furthermore, I am trying to propose a general framework or method to analyse the FDIA problem of any nonlinear time-varying cyber-physical systems.  And FDIAs facing voltage source converter based high voltage direct current transmission (VSC-HVDC) systems that play a vital role in modern power grids, will be studied as an demonstration of the proposed framework or method.</br>
      Finally, based on the smart grid co-simulation framework Mosaik and power grid calculation program pandapower, a test bed for FDIA strategies and defense strategies is developing. This test bed aims at automation of effectiveness analysis of new FDIA strategies and defense strategies. And most of the existing FDIA strategies and defense strategies will be included in this test bed.</p>

<h5><a name="stroke"><b>Optimal Dispatch of the Fengning Pumped-Storage Hydro Plant</b></a></h5>

  <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p>In this research, I built the mathematical model of optimal dispatch of the Fengning pumped-storage hydro plant and used Python working with LocalSolver to solve the optimization model. The load-following performance of the Fengning pumped-storage hydro plant coordinating with large-scale wind power was verified. Optimal unit combination of the Fengning pumped-storage hydro plant in different operation conditions of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid was obtained.</p>

      <p>This research aims at improving short-term voltage stability of the Beijing 220kv power grid by installing dynamic VAR compensators optimally. The main work of this research is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Studied the characteristic and the mathematical model of dynamic VAR compensators.</li>
        <li>Analysed the mechanism of short-term voltage stability and the relationship between short-term voltage stability and dynamic VAR compensation</li>
        <li>Proposed a novel surrogate modeling based multi-objective dynamic VAR planning approach considering short-term voltage stability and transient stability. Four multi-objective optimization algorithms, including NSGA-III, NSGA-II, MOEA/D and SPEA2 were used to solve the optimization model.</li>
        <li>Due to PSD-BPA, the power system analysis software used by Beijing Electric Power Cooperation, offers no interface with programming languages, a interface between PSD-BPA and Python was developed.</li>
        <li>The proposed approach was used to effectively solve the dynamic VAR planning problem of the Beijing 220kv power grid.</li>
        <li>And developed a user interface of the dynamic VAR planning program using Qt Designer in Python.</li>

      <p>This research is realted to two projects focusing on emerging issues, such as short-circuit current calculation, optimal power flow and short-term voltage stability, with the application of VSC-HVDC in the Liaoning power grid and Shannxi power grid, respectively. And in this research, I focused on the calculation of total transfer capacity (TTV) for AC/DC System with VSC-HVDC. I proposed a novel TTC calculation approach for AC/DC system with VSC-HVDC considering N-1 security constraints and VSC-HVDC control constraints accurately. The proposed approach is essentially to address a NLP or a MINLP probelm. <a href="https://ampl.com/" target="_blank">AMPL</a> (working with <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt" target="_blank">IPOPT</a> and <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Couenne" target="_blank">COUENNE</a>) was used to effectively solve the optimization model.
